    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe real-world examples of questions that can be answered with statistical inference.\n",
    "* Define common population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion, standard deviation) that are often estimated using sampled data, and estimate these from a sample.\n",
    "* Define the following statistical sampling terms (population, sample, population parameter, point estimate, sampling distribution).\n",
    "* Explain the difference between a population parameter and a sample point estimate.\n",
    "* Use Python to draw random samples from a finite population.\n",
    "* Use Python to create a sampling distribution from a finite population.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Why all this emphasis on sampling distributions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous section that we could compute a **point estimate** of a\n",
    "population parameter using a sample of observations from the population. And\n",
    "since we constructed examples where we had access to the population, we could\n",
    "evaluate how accurate the estimate was, and even get a sense of how much the\n",
    "estimate would vary for different samples from the population.  But in real\n",
    "data analysis settings, we usually have *just one sample* from our population\n",
    "and do not have access to the population itself. Therefore we cannot construct\n",
    "the sampling distribution as we did in the previous section. And as we saw, our\n",
    "sample estimate's value can vary significantly from the population parameter.\n",
    "So reporting the point estimate from a single sample alone may not be enough.\n",
    "We also need to report some notion of *uncertainty* in the value of the point\n",
    "estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we cannot construct the exact sampling distribution without\n",
    "full access to the population. However, if we could somehow *approximate* what \n",
    "the sampling distribution would look like for a sample, we could \n",
    "use that approximation to then report how uncertain our sample\n",
    "point estimate is (as we did above with the *exact* sampling\n",
    "distribution). There are several methods to accomplish this; in this book, we \n",
    "will use the \\index{bootstrap} *bootstrap*. We will discuss **interval estimation** and \n",
    "construct \\index{confidence interval}\\index{interval|see{confidence interval}} \n",
    "**confidence intervals** using just a single sample from a population. A \n",
    "confidence interval is a range of plausible values for our population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key idea. First, if you take a big enough sample, it *looks like*\n",
    "the population. Notice the histograms' shapes for samples of different sizes\n",
    "taken from the population in Figure \\@ref(fig:11-example-bootstrapping0). We\n",
    "see that the sample’s distribution looks like that of the population for a\n",
